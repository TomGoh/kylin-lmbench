# Experiment design

## Goal

Quantify the latency / bandwidth overhead introduced by **KVM** and especially
**protected-KVM (pKVM)** on aarch64 (Phytium D3000M), with a particular focus
on isolating which operations pay how much for the hypervisor.

The headline question we want to answer:

> For each class of workload, what is the cost ratio of running on
> pKVM-guest vs KVM-guest vs bare-metal-host?

And, where pKVM shows cost relative to KVM, can we attribute it to a specific
mechanism (stage-2 page-table walk, EL2 trap, bounce-buffer copy)?

## The hardware and what it constrains

Phytium D3000M, 8 cores:

| Cluster | CPUs | Max freq | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| 0 (id=88)  | cpu0–3 | cpu0–2: 1.9 GHz, **cpu3: 2.9 GHz** | 1 "big" + 3 "little" |
| 1 (id=572) | cpu4–7 | cpu4–6: 1.9 GHz, **cpu7: 2.9 GHz** | 1 "big" + 3 "little" |

Implications:

1. The two big cores live in **different clusters**. Any 2-vCPU "big" guest
   forces cross-cluster IPI / L2 traffic and can't be co-located on one L2.
   2-vCPU "little" guests can be either same-cluster (cpu0+cpu1) or
   cross-cluster (cpu0+cpu4) — useful as a control for "cluster crossing cost".
2. Same `CPU part` (0x862) for all cores. Empirically (see pilot data), at the
   **same locked frequency**, big and little cores produce indistinguishable
   numbers (±2 %) on every lmbench benchmark. Conclusion: the difference is
   binning/voltage, not microarchitecture. **One frequency-locked baseline is
   enough** — we don't need to track big vs little separately.

## Variables and how they are controlled

| Variable | Risk if uncontrolled | Control |
|----------|----------------------|---------|
| CPU frequency | 1.5× swing between cores | `prepare-host.sh` locks **all** cores to 1.9 GHz (the floor) with `performance` governor; min == max == 1900 kHz |
| Deep idle (C-states) | Wake-up latency contaminates `lat_ctx`, `lat_sig` | `prepare-host.sh` disables `cpuidle/state[1-9]/disable` |
| Transparent huge pages | Adds variance to `lat_pagefault`, `lat_mmap` | `transparent_hugepage=never` |
| ASLR | Tiny systematic noise via page-table layout | `randomize_va_space=0` |
| CPU affinity | Big.LITTLE migration + cluster crossings | External `taskset -c $CORE` wraps the whole `scripts/lmbench` invocation |
| `lat_rpc` requires rpcbind | Otherwise emits errors instead of data | `prepare-host.sh` starts `rpcbind` if available |
| Page cache state between iterations | Cold-vs-warm flips for file-backed benches | **Not** flushed between iters — keeping the system warm across iterations gives lower variance than alternating cold/warm |

Pilot data (10 iters × 2 cores) confirmed MAD/median < 1.4 % across all
benchmarks once the above controls are in place, so additional cache-flushing
or sleeping between iterations is unnecessary.

## Environment matrix

| ENV_TAG          | What it is | When to run |
|------------------|-----------|--------------|
| `baremetal`      | Boot with `kvm-arm.mode=` removed from cmdline | Once, gives absolute zero point |
| `pkvm-host`      | Current default cmdline (`kvm-arm.mode=protected`), no guest | Always, gives "EL2 always-resident" baseline |
| `kvm-guest`      | QEMU/KVM guest, `kvm-arm.mode=nvhe` (reboot to switch) | Comparison vs protected guest |
| `pkvm-guest-np`  | crosvm non-protected guest under pKVM | Isolates pKVM hyp-call cost without the bounce-buffer tax |
| `pkvm-guest`     | crosvm protected guest under pKVM | The real "production pKVM" measurement |

For every environment we run `bench.sh` with the same CONFIG so the benchmark
set is identical — only the surrounding environment changes.

## Benchmark selection rationale

The full `make results` of upstream lmbench runs a lot of things irrelevant to
the hypervisor question (e.g. NIC bandwidth, raw disk seek, FS create/delete).
`configs/CONFIG.host` enables a curated subset:

### Kept (hypervisor-sensitive)

* **`lat_syscall` null/read/write/stat/fstat/open** — direct EL0↔EL1 trap; the
  cleanest measurement of "the cost of asking the kernel anything".
* **`lat_sig` install/catch/prot** — signal delivery + `mprotect`.
* **`lat_pipe` / `lat_unix` / `bw_pipe` / `bw_unix`** — IPC latency and bandwidth.
* **`lat_proc` fork/exec/shell** — process creation, which triggers stage-2
  page-table population in protected guests.
* **`lat_ctx` -s {0,4,8,16,32,64} {2,4,8,16,24,32,64,96}** — 6×8 grid of context-switch
  cost vs working-set size and process count; the working-set sweep separates
  "raw switch cost" from "cache pollution cost".
* **`lat_pagefault` / `lat_mmap`** size sweep — minor page faults; in a pKVM
  protected guest each first-touch can trigger stage-2 PTE allocation.
* **`lat_select -n {10,100,250,500}`** — separates per-syscall and per-fd cost.
* **`lat_udp/tcp/rpc/connect localhost`** — exercises the full protocol stack
  over loopback (no NIC variability) but still goes through `virtio` in guests.
* **`bw_tcp -m {…}` size sweep** — plotted as latency vs message size, the slope
  difference between KVM and pKVM is the per-byte cost of pKVM's shared-buffer
  bounce — likely the **largest single source of pKVM-specific overhead**.
* **`lat_mem_rd` at strides 16/32/64/128/256/512/1024 + `-t` (random)** —
  the random-stride mode at 4 KB+ stride defeats prefetchers, giving true DRAM
  latency. Compares cache-hierarchy behavior across environments; stage-2 walks
  may inflate the DRAM-segment numbers in protected guests.
* **`tlb`** — effective TLB capacity. **Critical for pKVM**: stage-2 walks
  consume TLB resource shared with the guest's stage-1.
* **`par_mem` / `stream` / STREAM2** — memory parallelism and sustained
  bandwidth. Largely insensitive to hypervisor; included as sanity check (these
  should be roughly identical across environments — if they're not, something
  is wrong with our pinning or memory allocation).

### Deliberately skipped

* **`lat_http`** — needs `webpage-lm` tarball unpacked + port 8008 listener in
  every guest; setup variance dominates.
* **`bw_file_rd` / `bw_mmap_rd` / `lmdd` / `lat_fs`** — raw disk / FS-specific.
  Adds disk subsystem and filesystem implementation as confounds.
* **`bw_mem` flavors (bcopy/fcp/cp/frd/fwr/wr/rdwr)** — captured indirectly via
  STREAM / lat_mem_rd; the individual flavors mainly probe libc memcpy variants,
  not hypervisor behavior.
* **`lat_ops`** — pure arithmetic micro-ops; hypervisor has no path involved.
* **All remote networking** — out of scope; we want to compare hypervisors, not
  NIC drivers.

## Pilot vs full suite (historical note)

Before settling on driving `scripts/lmbench` directly, an earlier iteration used
a custom benchmark wrapper (`run-pilot.sh` + `run-mem.sh`). That code is kept
in the repo as a fast (~10 min) smoke test, useful for verifying that the
environment is healthy before kicking off a multi-hour `bench.sh` run.

The full `bench.sh` run with `CONFIG.host` is expected to take roughly
25–35 minutes per iteration. 10 iterations × 2 cores ≈ 9–12 hours, intended to
run overnight.

## Statistical handling (downstream of this repo)

`parse-lmbench.py` emits long-format CSV; aggregation is intentionally
out-of-band. Recommended pipeline:

1. Concatenate all `<env>-cpu*.csv` files into one master table.
2. Group by `(env, core, bench, variant)`, compute median and MAD across iters.
3. For paired comparisons (e.g. `pkvm-guest` vs `kvm-guest` on the same core),
   use per-iteration paired differences and report median + interquartile range.
4. Flag any `(env, core, bench, variant)` cell where MAD/median > 5 % as a
   data-quality issue worth investigating before reporting.

Empirically, pilot data showed MAD/median < 1.4 % on every benchmark — so a
5 % flag is loose. Tighten as needed once the full data set is in.
